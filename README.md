# Brief

This is the homework project for the course "Deep Learning a gyakorlatban Python Ã©s Lua alapokon" for the team ^

The project's documentation can be found in the Documentation.pdf file. An ieee template-based documentation is also available as IEEE_Documentation.pdf.

The directory stockExchangePrediction contains the project in a modular format, and the Stock market pred 1.0.ipynb is the first milestone, the Stock Market pred 2.0.ipynb is the second, and the Stock market 3.0.ipynb is the final version of the project as a Jupyter Notebook. You can use that or the project istelf, whose files are the following:

* legacy.py: not used
* preprocessingAndTraining:not used
* theNetwork.py:not used

* setup.py: the inputs used everywhere
* stockInput.py: reading in the stock data
* stockVisualisation.py: represent the stock data on graphicons
* stockPreprocessing.py: preprocessing stock data
* mewsInput.py: reading in and preprocessing news data
* testOnApple.py: testing network on apples data
* testing.py: testing the final network

Run the testing.py to run all used files!
The data was acquired from kaggle, so a kaggle key is needed for running the data download part of the project.
